# comment-classification-model
This is for a submission for CS440 to the NLBSE 2025 call to improve comment classification for Java, Python, and Pharo using a Hugging Face model. 

# How to train the model for yourself:
	1.	Clone the repository.
	2.	Install the required dependencies from requirements.txt.
	3.	Run the provided train.py script, specifying the lang parameter (java, python, or pharo) to train and evaluate the corresponding model.
	4.	Use the inference.py script to classify new code comments.
	5.	For more information on the training of the models read the Multi_Label_Classification_of_Code_Comments_Using_Transformer_Based_Models.pdf
